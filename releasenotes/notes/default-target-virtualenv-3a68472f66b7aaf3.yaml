    Fixes an issue introduced by the release of ``pip`` version 10, whereby the
    Python ``docker`` package would fail to install. This is resolved by using
    a remote Python virtual environment for executing Kayobe Ansible tasks by
    default. See `Story 2002010
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002010>`__ for details.
upgrade:
  - |
    Modifies the default ``kayobe-config`` configuration to use a remote Python
    virtual environment for executing Kayobe Ansible tasks. This affects hosts
    in the ``seed``, ``seed-hypervisor``, and ``overcloud`` groups. Due to a
    limitation in Ansible, the ``ansible_python_interpreter`` variable set in
    the inventory ``group_vars`` must be hard coded, and must be manually
    changed to reflect any change in the ``base_path`` or ``virtualenv_path``
    variables. See `Story 2002010
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002010>`__ for details.
